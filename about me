Hi, I'm @ad0lle.

I'm a student at University of Maryland, College park ; I enjoy web development and creative coding.

I'm learning front-end frameworks and cloud deployment, and I'm interested in building tools that are useful, accessible, and a little bit fun.

Looking to collaborate on projects that support learning, creativity, or community.

How to reach me: adolle@terpmail.umd.edu
