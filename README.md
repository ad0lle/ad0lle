## Hello! Im ad0lle

II’m currently a student at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I study Information Science and Philosophy. I’m especially interested in web development, creative coding, and building useful tools that solve real problems. Right now, I’m focused on learning front-end frameworks and exploring cloud deployment to enhance how I build and ship projects.

I am passionate about artificial intelligence and love applying it creatively. Outside of tech, and ib love of dogs — they’re a big part of my life. My general mindset? .... 


I feel a commitment to open source and free software comes from a belief that our current systems often exploit people’s lack of access to knowledge and their yearning for identity — treating both as commodities rather than rights.
