### Hello! Im ad0lle

I’m currently a student at the University of Maryland, College Park, studying Information Science and Philosophy. I’m passionate about web development, creative coding, and building tools that solve real problems. Right now, I’m focused on learning front-end frameworks and exploring cloud deployment — all to improve how I build and ship projects.

I also have a strong interest in artificial intelligence, especially in using it creatively.

Outside of tech? I love dogs — they’re a big part of my life.
As for my general mindset: always learning, always questioning.


#### What I Make Here

On this account, I share resources inspired by things I’ve learned in college. I believe education shouldn’t be an investment. Too often, institutions (mine included) use open-source materials while still trying to enforce traditional publishing control. That’s not openness — that’s branding.

It’s like hosting a free concert in the park, then suing someone for humming your song the next day. Mixed messages, right?

I believe a commitment to open source and free software comes from recognizing that today’s systems often exploit people’s lack of access to knowledge and their desire for identity — treating both as commodities, not rights.
